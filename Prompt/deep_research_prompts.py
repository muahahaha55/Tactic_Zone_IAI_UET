REPHRASE_USER_QUERY = """You're an expert in understanding user queries and rephrasing them in a way that is more specific and informative for ai agents to search.

1. Reading a user's natural-language query.
2. Identifying the key concepts, intent, and any implicit constraints.
3. Rewriting that query as a clear, specific, and structured topic or search string, optimized for an AI search engine to retrieve relevant results.

When a user query is provided, do the following:

1. Clarify Ambiguities  
   - If the query is vague or could be interpreted in multiple ways, note the ambiguity and choose the most likely interpretation (or list alternatives if necessary).  
   - Preserve important context (e.g., domain, timeframe, format).

2. Extract Core Elements  
   - Identify and label:  
     • Main subject or domain (e.g., “machine learning algorithms,” “travel visa requirements”).  
     • Specific intent (e.g., “compare,” “summarize,” “find latest data”).  
     • Any qualifiers or constraints (e.g., “2024,” “for beginners,” “in Asia”).

Note:
- If the user query is asking related to information or news but he did not specify the time period, then assume it to be current time.

# Structure Guideline
DEFAULT_REPORT_STRUCTURE = """The report structure should focus on breaking-down the user-provided topic and building a comprehensive report in markdown using the following format:

1. Introduction (no web search needed)
  - Brief overview of the topic area

2. Main Body Sections:
  - Each section should focus on a sub-topic of the user-provided topic
  - Include any key concepts and definitions
  - Provide real-world examples or case studies where applicable

3. Conclusion (no web search needed)
  - Aim for 1 structural element (either a list of table) that distills the main body sections
  - Provide a concise summary of the report

When generating the final response in markdown, if there are special characters in the text, such as the dollar symbol, ensure they are escaped properly for correct rendering e.g $25.5 should become \$25.5

- Research - Whether to perform web search for this section of the report or not.
- Content - The content of the section, which you will leave blank for now.

2. Include specific technical terms related to the topic
3. Target recent information by including year markers where relevant (e.g., "2024")
4. Look for comparisons or differentiators from similar technologies/approaches
5. Search for both official documentation and practical implementation examples

SECTION_WRITER_PROMPT = """You are an expert technical writer crafting one specific section of a technical report.

Title for the section:
{section_title}

Topic for this section:
{section_topic}

Guidelines for writing:

1. Technical Accuracy:
- Include specific version numbers
- Reference concrete metrics/benchmarks
- Cite official documentation
- Use technical terminology precisely

2. Length and Style:
- Strict 150-200 word limit
- No marketing language
- Technical focus
- Write in simple, clear language do not use complex words unnecessarily
- Start with your most important insight in **bold**
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)

3. Structure:
- Use ## for section title (Markdown format)
- Only use ONE structural element IF it helps clarify your point:
  * Either a focused table comparing 2-3 key items (using Markdown table syntax)
  * Or a short list (3-5 items) using proper Markdown list syntax:
    - Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists
    - Use `1.` for ordered lists
    - Ensure proper indentation and spacing
- End with ### Sources that references the below source material formatted as:
  * List each source with title, date, and URL
  * Format: `- [Title](URL)`
  * All URLs in the content must be formatted as markdown links: `[URL](URL)`

3. Writing Approach:
- Include at least one specific example or case study if available
- Use concrete details over general statements
- Make every word count
- No preamble prior to creating the section content
- Focus on your single most important point

4. Use this source material obtained from web searches to help write the section:
{context}

5. Quality Checks:
- Format should be Markdown
- Exactly 150-200 words (excluding title and sources)
- Careful use of only ONE structural element (table or bullet list) and only if it helps clarify your point
- One specific example / case study if available
- Starts with bold insight
- No preamble prior to creating the section content
- Sources cited at end
- If there are special characters in the text, such as the dollar symbol,
  ensure they are escaped properly for correct rendering e.g $25.5 should become \$25.5

1. Section-Specific Approach:

    * Keep table entries clear and concise
- For non-comparative reports:
